# FunWithShapes
The idea of this project is to have a python app that generates cool images with shapes inside of other shapes following a certain logic that i saw once during my studies and would like to recreate that.
My goal is to finish this by the end of the week. Today is 03/04/2024 and I should hopefully be done by 07/04/2024. Let's get to it!
